                ],
                correct: 'A',
                explanation: 'Newton\'s First Law of Motion, also known as the Law of Inertia, states that an object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion continues to move at constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force.

                ],
                correct: 'B',
                explanation: 'Waves transfer energy without transferring matter. This is a fundamental characteristic of all waves. For example, when you drop a stone in water, the ripples carry energy outward, but the water molecules themselves only move up and down - they don\'t travel with the wave. Similarly, sound waves transfer energy through air without moving the air from one place to another.'

                ],
                correct: 'B',
                explanation: 'In a transverse wave, the oscillations (vibrations) are perpendicular (at 90°) to the direction of energy transfer. Think of a wave on a string - if you move the string up and down, the wave travels horizontally along the string, but the oscillations are vertical. Light waves and water surface waves are examples of transverse waves. Option A describes longitudinal waves like sound.'

                correct: 'B',
                explanation: 'Frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz), named after Heinrich Hertz. Since frequency is the number of waves per second, 1 Hz = 1 wave per second. Meters (m) is the unit for wavelength and distance, while seconds (s) is the unit for time and period. For example, if 5 waves pass a point in 1 second, the frequency is 5 Hz.'

                correct: 'B',
                explanation: 'Amplitude is the maximum displacement from the rest (equilibrium) position. It represents how far the wave oscillates from its central position and determines the energy carried by the wave. Option A describes wavelength (distance between peaks), and option C describes frequency. In sound waves, amplitude determines loudness; in light waves, it determines brightness.'

                question: 'Longitudinal waves have oscillations parallel to the direction of energy transfer. Which is an example?',

                ],
                correct: 'B',
                explanation: 'Sound waves are longitudinal waves. In sound, air particles vibrate back and forth in the same direction as the wave travels, creating regions of compression (particles squeezed together) and rarefaction (particles spread apart). Light waves are transverse electromagnetic waves, and water surface waves are primarily transverse (though they have some longitudinal component).'

                question: 'Which equation correctly relates wave velocity, frequency, and wavelength?',

                ],
                correct: 'B',
                explanation: 'The wave equation is v = f × λ (velocity = frequency × wavelength). This fundamental relationship shows that wave speed equals the number of waves per second multiplied by the length of each wave. For example, if a wave has frequency 10 Hz and wavelength 2 m, its velocity is 10 × 2 = 20 m/s. This equation applies to all types of waves.'

                correct: 'A',
                explanation: 'The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection, both measured from the normal (a line perpendicular to the surface). This applies to all types of waves - light reflecting off mirrors, sound echoing off walls, or water waves bouncing off barriers. This principle is fundamental to how mirrors, periscopes, and many optical devices work.'

                correct: 'B',
                explanation: 'Light is a transverse wave. In electromagnetic waves like light, the electric and magnetic fields oscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation and perpendicular to each other. This transverse nature of light can be demonstrated through polarization - polarizing filters can block light oscillating in certain directions, which wouldn\'t be possible if light were longitudinal.'

                question: 'When two waves meet, they can interfere with each other. What is interference?',

                ],
                correct: 'A',
                explanation: 'Interference occurs when waves combine to produce a new wave pattern. This can result in constructive interference (waves add up to create larger amplitudes) or destructive interference (waves subtract to create smaller amplitudes or cancel out). Option B describes only destructive interference, while option C describes reflection. Interference is fundamental to many phenomena including noise-canceling headphones and the colors in soap bubbles.'

                question: 'Use the wave equation v = fλ, rearranged to find wavelength: λ = v/f',

                ],
                correct: 'A',
                explanation: 'Using λ = v/f: λ = 340 m/s ÷ 100 Hz = 3.4 m. Remember that Hz means "per second," so we\'re dividing 340 meters per second by 100 per second, giving 3.4 meters. This is actually close to the wavelength of sound at this frequency in air. Option B would be if you multiplied (340 × 100), and option C would be if you added (340 + 100).'
